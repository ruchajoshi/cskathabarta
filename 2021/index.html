We will discuss existing volume visualization algorithms and see how these can be applied to medical volumes like CT and MRI. Without effective visualization, understanding such medical data is difficult. To this end we will discuss newer methods such as a graph based volume visualization algorithm developed at our research group. We will also look at applying AI based intelligence to transform medical imaging data to more a meaningful representation. </td>

                    <td>Increasing number of patents and papers attest to the fact that smart materials-based smart structures/systems have a high potential of being applied in our day-to-day applications. The current scenario shows that the physics, chemistry, and engineering disciplines are the ones who have any exposure to the field of smart materials. This exposure has motivated the researchers to study the material to develop innovative devices to assist and improve human life. The vast list of smart systems includes examples from tiny Nitinol-based self-expandable coronary stents to Piezo-based structural health/condition monitoring of huge composite wind turbine blades and many more. However, these deployments are mostly limited to small scales.
This talk presents an introduction to smart materials and recent innovative research in the field of smart materials-based systems (such as structural health monitoring (SHM) of composites using piezoceramic transducers and others) to faculty and students of the computer science department at NISER. While the physical smart material’s components act as limbs for sensing and actuation of the smart structures, 
computer systems act as the brain for efficient operations of these smart structures. However limited understanding, knowledge, and expertise of smart materials among CS have throttled the applicability and development of smart structures on a large scale. A harmonious collaboration between computer science and engineering researchers can lead to the development of integrated Next-gen smart systems for the betterment of humanity all around the globe. This talk will also briefly present other successful applications of smart materials for SHM, actuation, and sensing in the field of civil, energy, and medical industry, which can be helpful for the development of future smart cities. All these research and development activities for the future could fall short if the next generation of engineers and researchers do not think out of the box with the knowledge they have. </td>

                    <td>We address the problem of localizing an (unauthorized) transmitter using a distributed set of
                        sensors. Our focus is on developing techniques that perform the transmitter localization in an
                        efficient manner,
                        wherein the efficiency is defined in terms of the number of sensors used to localize.
                        Localization of
                        unauthorized transmitters is an important problem which arises in many important applications,
                        e.g., in
                        patrolling of shared spectrum systems for any unauthorized users. Localization of transmitters
                        is generally done
                        based on observations from a deployed set of sensors with limited resources, thus it is
                        imperative to design
                        techniques that minimize the sensors’ energy resources. In this paper, we design greedy
                        approximation algorithms
                        for the optimization problem of selecting a given number of sensors in order to maximize an
                        appropriately
                        defined objective function of localization accuracy. The obvious greedy algorithm delivers a
                        constant-factor
                        approximation only for the special case of two hypotheses (potential locations). For the general
                        case of
                        multiple hypotheses, we design a greedy algorithm based on an appropriate auxiliary objective
                        function—and show
                        that it delivers a provably approximate solution for the general case. We develop techniques to
                        significantly
                        reduce the time complexity of the designed algorithms by incorporating certain observations and
                        reasonable
                        assumptions. We evaluate our techniques over multiple simulation platforms, including an indoor
                        as well as an
                        outdoor testbed, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our designed techniques—our techniques
                        easily outperform
                        prior and other approaches by up to 50-60% in large-scale simulations and up to 16% in
                        small-scale testbeds. </td>
